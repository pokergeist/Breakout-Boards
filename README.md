# Breakout-Boards

This is my collection of various breakout boards that do one or more of the following:
  * expose a removable MCU board's pins for headers or soldering
  * make edge-pinned boards like Adafruit's ItsyBitsy adaptable to a protoboard
  * add an I2C Qwiic/STEMMA QY port
  * expose debug pins SWDIO and SWCLK (SAMD21/M0).
